# Shoppingfy

## The silent shopping friend you need

```
 *** Walks into a grocery store ***
 		"Why am I here"
 *** Walks out of grocery store ***
  		"Oh now I remember"

```

We've all been there, trying to remember the most complicated shopping list and finally forgetting the simplest of items. To help simplify this horrible experince I have built **[Shoppingfy](https://shoppingfy.vercel.app/).**

## Welcome to Shoppingfy

A React-Redux Application which serves as your partner when it comes to shopping. Prepare a shopping list from a plethora of already available items, or even better add your own custom items.

Prepare the shopping cart of your choice and save them for future use.

But there's more, have a detailed statitics for the items you have shopped available to you at all times.

### Steps to start your application

1. Clone the project using `https://github.com/abhu-A-J/shoppingfy.git`.
2. Move into the directory using `cd shoppingfy`.
3. Install all the dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Start the application using `npm start`.
5. The application will be served at `https://localhost:3000`.
